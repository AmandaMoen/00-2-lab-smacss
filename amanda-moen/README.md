##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I referenced the Readme.md for this lab assignment, along with the following websites/pages as references:
- https://smacss.com/book/type-base
- https://smacss.com/book/type-layout
- https://smacss.com/book/type-module
- http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/smacss/breakdown.html

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No, but with some one on one help/better understanding of what goes where, I would be more than willing to.
